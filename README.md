# AI-Powered Waste & Spill Detection System

## Description
An intelligent waste management solution that leverages AI-powered surveillance to detect garbage and spills in real-time. The system automates task allocation to cleanup crews, enables public reporting of waste, and incentivizes community participation through rewards. Our solution utilizes Groq's high-performance AI inference for rapid detection and sentiment analysis, alongside Fluvio for real-time data streaming and processing.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Groq API Key
- Fluvio Cluster (self-hosted or cloud)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-detection-system.git
cd waste-detection-system
```

### Step 2: Setup Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your Groq API key and Fluvio configuration
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Step 4: Setup Fluvio
```bash
# Install Fluvio CLI
curl -fsS https://packages.fluvio.io/v1/install.sh | bash

# Start local Fluvio cluster (if not using cloud)
fluvio cluster start

# Create necessary topics
fluvio topic create waste-detections
fluvio topic create cleanup-tasks
fluvio topic create user-reports
fluvio topic create sentiment-analysis
```

### Step 5: Configure Groq Integration
```bash
# Set up Groq API key in your environment
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Test Groq connection
python scripts/test_groq_connection.py
```

### Step 6: Start the Services
