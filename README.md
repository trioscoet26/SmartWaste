  🛠️ Role: Developer

### Your Approach:  
## 🚀 Why We Chose This Problem Statement

- 🏙️ **Urban waste is a major challenge** — Large cities face daily garbage overflow and slow cleanup processes.
- ⚡ **Manual waste detection is slow** — Current systems rely heavily on human observation, causing delays.
- 🛠️ **Crew management is inefficient** — Task assignment is often manual and leads to longer response times.
- 🧹 **Low community participation** — Citizens are rarely motivated to report waste problems.
- 🌱 **Resource wastage** — Recyclable materials often end up in landfills due to poor waste tracking.
- 🎁 **Rewarding citizens with GreenCoins** — Boosts public participation by offering discounts in a sustainable marketplace.
- ♻️ **Promotes a circular economy** — Encourages recycling, reduces waste, and supports green businesses.
 
## ⚡ Key Challenges We Faced

### Accuracy in Garbage and Spill Detection
- **Problem**: Difficult to detect garbage and spills accurately from CCTV footage. Backgrounds often confused the model.
- **Solution**: Expanded the dataset with diverse samples and fine-tuned model parameters for better results in different conditions.

### Automating Task Allocation
- **Problem**: Standard logic couldn't handle real-time task assignments in unpredictable city environments.
- **Solution**: Developed a dynamic system that assigns tasks based on location, urgency, and crew availability.

---

## Other Challenges We Overcame

### Approving Citizen Reports by Checking Authenticity
- **Problem**: Some citizen reports were false or irrelevant, wasting resources.
- **Solution**: Built an approval machanisms for officers and officers to approve only genuine and trustworty reports.

### Real-Time Data Streaming and Processing
- **Problem**: Handling massive real-time data from cameras and citizen apps without system lag.
- **Solution**: Integrated Fluvio and Groq AI to stream and process data quickly and reliably.

### Designing the Reward System (GreenCoins)
- **Problem**: Needed a fair system to reward genuine participation without abuse.
- **Solution**: Implemented GreenCoins with checks to prevent spamming and encourage real, useful reports.
